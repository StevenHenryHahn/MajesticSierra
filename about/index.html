      <h2>About Majestic Sierra</h2>
      <p>Majestic Sierra is website dedicated to the rapidly evolving world of AI.  Rather than focusing strictly on the software of AI, 
        the goal is more intended to showcase the infrastructure underlying it and, in particular, the companies that are building it.  
        It is designed as a modular web platform that balances live AI-relevant news-feeds with editorial control from the site's creator,
        Steve Hahn.

          <h2>Steven H. Hahn</h2>
          <p>Steve Hahn has spent his life exploring the intersection of technology and finance. </p>
          <p>He earned an MBA from the University of Southern California in the mid-1990s where he focused on the then-nascent Internet,
             corporate-level infrastructure strategy, and database design for ERP-class systems.  Prior to that, he received a 
             multidisciplinary BS from Babson College where he studied Finance/Investments and Economics.</p>
          <p>Professionally, Steve has worked in roles spanning development of PeopleSoft Financials and multiple Energy Trading and Risk
            Management (ETRM) systems.  Earlier in his career, he worked in accounting, helping a New Jersey-based CPA firm
            transition from paper-based bookkeeping to computerized systems.</p>
           <p> Majestic Sierra reflects Steveâ€™s ongoing interest in modular systems, editorial clarity, and the infrastructure powering 
            emerging technologies.
